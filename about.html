            <h2>Why I Created This Website </h2>
            <p>The reason that I wanted to make a social media website is because I thought it would be challenging and fun to try and create. I haven't had much web development experience
                in the past, so this was a way for me to make sure I'm learning the material. I know that this website is going to look similar to
                other social media pages, but the main goal of this website is to showcase what I have learned in the class throughout the semester </p>
            <h2>Goals for the Website </h2>
            <p>Towards the end of the semester I hope that this website will be able to have profile pages where users can follow one another. Another goal
                is to have an active home and personal page, as well as  the ability to create, commment, and like other people's posts. If I can achieve all of 
                these goals then the last thing that I would like users to be able to do is share a private inbox chat with one another. </p>
            <h2>About Me </h2>
            <p>I am a Undergraduate Computer Science student at Boise State University set to graduate in Spring 2021. I'm taking
                this class because I wanted to learn more about how web development worked, and the things that I could apply it to.
                I wanted to make this project something that would be meaningful and useful to other people, as well as myself.  </p>
